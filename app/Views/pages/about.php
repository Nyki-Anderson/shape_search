            <h2>About Us!</h2>
        
            <p>We are a student project aimed at gaining an understanding  of php, css, javascript, and CodeIgniter using the MVC framework. We are attending Old Dominion University as Computer Science majors.</p>

            <p>We have had several NASA internships at both NASA Ames Research Center and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. These projects involved programming an xml visualization tool mapping flight trajectory conflicts and developing a low-cost star tracker using commercial-off-the-shelf components. It was during these internships that we found a passion for programming.</p>

            <p>We are developing Shape Search for fun! We just have a love of coding and want to bring something simple yet elegant into the world.</p>
